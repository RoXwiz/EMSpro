I have created an online employee management system admin part using JSP and Servlet which are based on the JAVA language. 
In this system, I have to implement essential admin operations such as admin login, admin registration, admin profile update/delete and employee adding function. 
All these operations are monitoring via the admin. To do that I have created the admin dashboard in this system.
By using this dashboard, the admin can easily operate the system.

Technology Stack :
JAVA | Servlet | JSP | MySQL
